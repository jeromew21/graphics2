# graphics2.py

Being a big fan of clean APIs and good abstraction, [graphics.py](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf) is one of my favorite things to use if I need a quick and dirty GUI for Python.

## Just swap in graphics2 wherever you use graphics

The API is identical (will be when this is completed), so you can simply drop this file in your project and import it instead.
