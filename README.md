# graphics2.py

Being a big fan of clean APIs and good abstraction, [graphics.py](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf) is one of my favorite things to use if I need a quick and dirty GUI for Python.

## Motivation

Graphics is *lovely*, but lacking in performance (it uses Tkinter as a backend). graphics2 uses Pygame instead

## Usage

### Just swap in graphics2 wherever you use graphics

The API is identical (will be when this is completed), so you can simply drop this file in your project and import it instead.

## Additional features

- Set icon
